Eddie (1.5.3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have recently built Eddie successfully for:
    * Linux (Redhat 6.x, SuSE 6.x, Mandrake 9.x),
    * Solaris (2.6.0, 7.0)

Installation directions:

1.  Install Erlang/OTP R9B-1 (http://www.erlang.org/download.html)

    Ensure "erl" & "erlc" are in your standard path.
  
    Erlang must be compiled with SSL support. Check that the Erlang crypto
    module is properly installed on your system.

2.  Unpack this(!) source archive.

3.  ./configure

    By default Eddie installs itself into:
        /usr/local/sbin/eddie
        /usr/local/sbin/lbdns
        /usr/local/etc/eddie.conf
        /usr/local/etc/eddie.mig
        /usr/local/etc/eddie.gate
        /usr/local/lib/eddie/*

    You may want to change the installation prefix (instead of
    /usr/local/) by doing a ./configure --prefix <alternate installation prefix>

    Note: RPMs are built with --sysconfdir=/etc/eddie

4.  make

    You must use GNU make. If "make" isn't GNU make then type
    the appropriate command to invoke GNU make. You must also
    edit the eddie.mk produced by configure so that the MAKE
    variable equals "gmake" (or whatever GNU make is on your system).

5.  make install

    This should build Eddie succsessfully. Getting Eddie
    running requires an understanding of how your want to configure
    your cluster(s). Please read the documentation in the doc/ subtrees.

    Note: you must install as the 'root' user.
    As a number of Eddie programs are set uid root (those associated 
    with interfaces and routes).

    Put $<install prefix>/sbin in your path!

    This process needs to be repeated for each machine you
    install Eddie on.
